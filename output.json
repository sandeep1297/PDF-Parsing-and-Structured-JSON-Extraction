          "text": "MONTHLY MARKET UPDATE Equity Market Indian Equity Markets: May 2025 Indian benchmark equity indices witnessed marginal gains during the month. Markets corrected during the early part of May 2025 due to escalating tensions between India and Pakistan, following India’s launch of ‘Operation Sindoor’ targeting terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir. However, sentiment improved thereafter as tensions eased. The Nifty 50 and BSE Sensex indices posted monthly gains of 1.7% and 1.5%, respectively, in May 2025. However, the benchmark indices remain down by approximately 5-6% from their peak. Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) continued to remain net buyers for the second consecutive month with a net inflow of US$2.3 billion. Meanwhile, Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) bought US$7.9 billion during the month. The broader market indices' performance was comparatively much better, with BSE MidCap and BSE SmallCap reporting monthly gains of 5.3% and 10.6%, respectively. Among the sector indices, Defence, Industrials, Real Estate and Metals outperformed with month gains of 21.8%, 14.3%, 7.2% and 5.9%, respectively. However, Utilities and FMCG underperformed with monthly losses of 0.9% and 0.7%, respectively. India’s real GDP growth accelerated to 7.4% YoY in Q4FY25 from 6.4% in the previous quarter. In Q4FY25, the agriculture sector recorded healthy growth of 5.4%, supported by strong agricultural output. The manufacturing sector’s growth further recovered to 4.8% YoY from 3.6% YoY in the previous quarter. Services sector growth remained resilient as weakness in the Trade+ segment was more than offset by strong construction activity and improvement in the Financial Services+ segment. Private consumption growth slowed to 6.0% YoY in Q4FY25 from 8.1% in the previous quarter, as indicators point to subdued urban consumption. Fixed investment growth rebounded to 9.4% YoY in Q4 from 5.2% in Q3 as government capital expenditure picked up. For FY25, real GDP growth eased to 6.5% YoY from 9.2% in the previous year. Nominal GDP growth declined to 9.8% YoY in FY25 from 12% YoY in FY24, as weaker real GDP growth outweighed the impact of a higher GDP deflator (inflation). On the production side, the manufacturing sector witnessed the steepest decline in its contribution to GDP growth in FY25, while on the expenditure side, fixed investment experienced the sharpest drop in contribution, followed by government consumption. India’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation eased to 3.16% YoY in April 2025 from 3.34% in the previous month. The decline in headline inflation was driven by a fall in food inflation to 2.1% YoY in April 2025 from 2.9% YoY in March 2025. Core inflation (which excludes food and fuel) remained flat at 4.2% YoY. The IMD has updated the forecast for the Southwest Monsoon to 106% of the long-period average, up from the previous 105%. The IMD assigned a 59% likelihood to an above-normal or excess monsoon, a 31% chance of a normal monsoon, and only a 10% chance of it being below normal or deficient. Outlook The reciprocal tariffs announced on 2nd April pose a significant threat to global growth. These measures are likely to drive inflation in the United States and disrupt global trade flows. While India is relatively better positioned than many other countries, which may face steeper tariffs, its exports to the US are still expected to come under pressure due to a slowdown in the US economy. However, merchandise exports to the US amount to only 2% of GDP, which limits the impact of tariffs. With significant uncertainty surrounding the implementation of tariffs and their potential impact on global trade, the equity risk premium has the potential to rise across markets. Hence, investors should prepare for further volatility. The domestic macro environment is turning conducive to an economic recovery. First, income tax reductions will increase consumers' disposable income, benefiting consumption-driven sectors, particularly discretionary consumption. Second, food inflation is expected to remain benign due to robust agricultural production, which will further support consumption. Third, more interest rate cuts are expected in 2025 to stimulate the economy. Fourth, regulatory easing is also underway, with the RBI reversing the November 2023 hike in risk weights for bank loans to NBFCs and microfinance consumer credit loans. Looking ahead, we expect key shifts in market trends: • Growth leadership is shifting from government capital expenditures to consumer discretionary spending. • After an outperformance of around three years, Value may take a back seat, and Quality and growth factors may regain favour. Looking ahead, discretionary consumption is expected to rise, driven by budget stimulus for the urban middle class, followed by a pay commission-related boost next year. Additionally, liquidity easing, accompanied by rate cuts, would create a favourable premise for growth and quality to come back. • In our portfolios, we have been shifting some weight from Value to quality and growth over the last year. Several high-growth areas have strong value-creation potential. Key segments include auto EV plays, manufacturing, and pharma CDMO. The power transmission, distribution, and renewable energy sectors also present significant opportunities. Quick commerce is an emerging sector expected to experience exponential growth over the next five years. Additionally, telecom and high-quality private banks remain attractive value segments. We have consistently maintained a more favourable stance towards inward-looking sectors driven by domestic fundamentals, rather than those reliant on external or global factors. Our outlook continues to reflect this preference, as we believe domestic-oriented sectors offer greater resilience and stability amid global uncertainties.

The decline in headline inflation was driven by a fall in food inflation to 2.1% YoY in April 2025 from 2.9% YoY in March 2025. Within food, a lower contribution from vegetables drove the decline in headline inflation. Vegetable inflation eased to -11.0% YoY in April 2025 from -7.0% YoY in March, on account of a 3.0% MoM correction in vegetable prices. Core inflation (which excludes food and fuel) remained flat at 4.2% YoY. Underlying inflation pressures remained subdued, as indicated by a refined measure of core inflation (which additionally excludes transportation fuel and valuables), measuring 3.5% YoY in April 2025. The inflation outlook remains benign and especially in the next 6 months headline CPI will benefit from a big base effect as well. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced an all-time high dividend transfer of Rs 2.69 trillion to the Government of India. Furthermore, the revised range for the Contingency Risk Buffer (CRB) has been decided at 6.0 ± 1.5% of the balance sheet size (as against the existing level of 6.5%- 5.5%) – as part of the periodic review of the Economic Capital Framework. The CRB has been raised to 7.5%. The IMD has updated the forecast for the Southwest Monsoon to 106% (+/- 4%) of the long-period average (LPA), up from the previous 105% (+/- 5%). During June to September 2025, normal to above normal rainfall is very likely over most parts of the country, except some areas of Northwest and East India and many areas of Northeast India, where below normal rainfall is very likely. The average rainfall for the country as a whole during June 2025 is most likely to be above normal (>108% of LPA). In FY25, direct tax collection rose by 13% YoY to Rs. 21.7 tn, up from Rs. 19.2 tn in FY24 but fell short of the revised target of Rs. 22.4 tn by Rs. 673 bn, primarily due to a Rs. 740 bn shortfall in personal income tax. Disinvestment proceeds remained weak at Rs. 172 bn, well below the Rs. 330 bn target. Revenue expenditure increased by 3.1% YoY to Rs. 36 tn, lower than the revised estimate of Rs. 37 tn, while capital expenditure exceeded the target by Rs. 336 bn to reach Rs. 10.5 tn. The fiscal deficit target of 4.8% of GDP was met as budgeted. Global: Moody’s Ratings downgraded the United States’ last remaining top-tier credit rating, citing growing concerns over the country’s rising debt and persistent budget deficits. The agency cut the US rating from AAA to Aa1, aligning with earlier downgrades by Fitch and S&P Global, and marking the first time all three major agencies have rated the US below AAA. During the mid-month, US and China agreed to a 90-day tariff truce, with deeper-than-expected tariff cuts. Meanwhile, the uncertainty around the tariffs continued as the US federal court blocked the US President from imposing sweeping tariffs on imports under an emergency powers law. However, the US appeals court reinstated the US President's tariffs a day after they were deemed illegal. President Donald Trump announced that the US will double its current tariff rate on steel and aluminium imports from 25% to 50%, effective June 4, 2025. Trump also accused China of violating the Geneva deal. The US 10Y yield has surged by around 40bps in May to 4.6% (as of 21 May) amidst fiscal worries as US fiscal concerns are in focus with tax bill under consideration that could increase the US deficit by USD 3.8 trillion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

          "text": "MONTHLY MARKET UPDATE Debt Market While dovish policy continued in euro region (with another 25bps rate cut expectation in June) and China as PBoC cut key lending rates to record lows and reduced the reserve requirement ratio by 50bps. Local Markets: Despite significant volatility in global debt markets, domestic yields declined sharply last month. RBI continues to make largescale purchase of government securities from the secondary market as part of its operations to infuse liquidity into the banking system. Indian Fixed income markets remained supported in the month of May despite adverse global cues. The US yields climbed higher due to fiscal worries and firmer-than-expected economic activity data deferring interest rate cut expectations by the Fed. The UST 10Y yield has risen ~24 bps mom, closing the month of May at 4.40% (reaching highs of 4.63% during the month). Domestically, bond markets have rallied, barring the Indo-Pak border escalation episode. Favourable CPI inflation trends and record dividend announcement by the RBI supported the bond markets, though higher than expected GDP growth print at the end of the last week weighed on the bond market sentiments. The new benchmark 10Y G-sec is trading ~11 bps lower at around 6.21% since its issue. FPIs also continued inflows worth ~10k crores after profit booking in April. Average banking system liquidity surplus stood at Rs 1.7 lakh crore till mid-month and improved to ~2.2 lakh crore till the close of the month. RBI infused liquidity in the markets through Open Market Operations (OMOs) of Rs. 1.25 lakh crore exceeding market estimates on OMOs pushing the yield curve lower. We expect durable liquidity in the ~Rs5-6 trillion range over the next few months, with the flow of funds to the banking system expected to come with a lag as government spending picks up pace. we expect cash balances to moderate to around Rs2.7 trillion driven by debt buyback and continued government spending. Money market rates eased by 30bps across the 3-month to 1-year tenure favouring corporates and NBFC borrowers with risk premium narrowing with large infuse of liquidity. We think market has already priced in two rate cuts both in bonds and OIS markets, also spreads compressed between the G-sec and corporate bonds as investors subscribed for better accrual specially in the short-medium term yield curve i.e. 2–5-year maturity. The narrowing spread between the US treasury and India’s G-secs (at 165 bps it has narrowed by roughly three-quarters) may act as a deterrent for the yields to soften further significantly further add complexity of Japan rising yield and inflation. It is important to disentangle whether the narrowing gap is primarily due to India’s improving macroeconomic fundamentals or external developments like US monetary policy shifts. In truth, it is a combination of both. Outlook: Softening global commodity prices, above- normal rainfall expectations and probable improvement in agricultural output helping headline inflation remain benign. Combined with expectations of decline in the U.S. dollar index and anticipated rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve create further room for monetary easing in India leading to further decline in domestic yields in the coming months. We expect the Indian benchmark 10-year bond yield to trade in the 6.10-6.30% range taking into consideration scope for a deeper rate cut cycle and continued easy liquidity.

          "text": "GLOSSARY POTENTIAL RISK CLASS OF A SCHEME 360 ONE Asset Management Limited has positioned its debt schemes in terms of PRC matrix consisting of parameters based on maximum interest rate risk (measured by Macaulay Duration of the scheme) and maximum credit risk (measured by Credit Risk Value of the scheme). Accordingly, the debt schemes of the Mutual Fund shall be placed in PRC matrix as follows: Credit Risk of scheme → Relatively Low Moderate Relatively High Interest Rate Risk of the Scheme (Class A) (Class B) (Class C) A-I B-I C-I Relatively Low (Class I) NIL 360 ONE Liquid Fund NIL A - II B - II C-I Moderate (Class II) NIL NIL NIL A - III B - III C - III Relatively High (Class III) NIL NIL 360 ONE Dynamic Bond Fund GLOSSARY OF TERMS An employee of the asset management company such as a mutual fund or life insurer, who manages investments of the scheme. He is usually part of a FUND MANAGER larger team of fund managers and research analysts. APPLICATION AMOUNT FOR FRESH SUBSCRIPTION This is the minimum investment amount for a new investor in a mutual fund scheme. MINIMUM ADDITIONAL AMOUNT This is the minimum investment amount for an existing investor in a mutual fund scheme. The Yield to Maturity or the YTM is the rate of return anticipated on a bond if held until maturity. YTM is expressed as an annual rate. The YTM factors in YIELD TO MATURITY the bond's current market price, par value, coupon interest rate and time to maturity. SIP or systematic investment plan works on the principle of making periodic investments of a fixed sum. It works similar to a recurring bank deposit. For SIP instance, an investor may opt for an SIP that invests ` 500 every 15th of the month in an equity fund for a period of three years. The NAV or the net asset value is the total asset value per unit of the mutual fund after deducting all related and permissible expenses. The NAV is NAV calculated at the end of every business day. It is the value at which the investor enters or exits the mutual fund. A group of securities, usually a market index, whose performance is used as a standard or benchmark to measure investment performance of mutual BENCHMARK funds, among other investments. Some typical benchmarks include the Nifty, Sensex, BSE200, BSE500, 10-Year Gsec. A mutual fund may have a sales charge or load at the time of entry and/or exit to compensate the distributor/agent. Entry load is charged at the time an ENTRY LOAD investor purchases the units of a mutual fund. The entry load is added to the prevailing NAV at the time of investment. For instance, if the NAV is ` 100 and the entry load is 1 %, the investor will enter the fund at ` 101. Exit load is charged at the time an investor redeems the units of a mutual fund. The exit load is deducted from the prevailing NAV at the time of EXIT LOAD redemption. For instance, if the NAV is ` 100 and the exit load is 1%, the redemption price would be `99 per unit. MODIFIED DURATION Modified duration is the price sensitivity and the percentage change in price for a unit change in yield. Standard deviation is a statistical measure of the range of an investment's performance. When a mutual fund has a high standard deviation, its means its STANDARD DEVIATION range of performance is wide, implying greater volatility. The Sharpe Ratio, named after its founder, the Nobel Laureate William Sharpe, is a measure of risk-adjusted returns. It is calculated using SHARPE RATIO standard deviation and excess return to determine reward per unit of risk. Beta is a measure of an investment's volatility vis-a-vis the market. Beta of less than 1 means that the security will be less volatile than the market. A beta BETA of greater than 1 implies that the security's price will be more volatile than the market. R-squared measures the relationship between a portfolio and its benchmark index. It measures the correlation of the portfolio's returns to the R-SQUARED benchmark's returns. Developed by Jack Treynor, the Treynor ratio (also known as the \"reward-to-volatility ratio\") attempts to measure how well an investment has TREYNOR RATIO compensated its investors given its level of risk. The Treynor ratio relies on beta, which measures an investment's sensitivity to market movements, to gauge risk. AUM or assets under management refers to the recent I updated cumulative market value of investments managed by a mutual fund or any investment AUM firm. TRACKING ERROR Means the annualized standard deviation of the difference in daily returns between the underlying index and the NAV of the Scheme. TRACKING DIFFERENCE Means the annualized difference of daily returns between the index and the NAV of the Scheme. The holdings or the portfolio is a mutual fund's latest or updated reported statement of investments/securities. These are usually displayed in terms HOLDINGS of percentage to net assets or the rupee value or both. The objective is to give investors an idea of where their money is being invested by the fund manager. The investment objective and underlying investments determine the nature of the mutual fund scheme. For instance, a mutual fund that aims at generatNATURE OF SCHEME ing capital appreciation by investing in stock markets is an equity fund or growth fund. Likewise, a mutual fund that aims at capital preservation by investing in debt markets is a debt fund or income fund. Each of these categories may have sub-categories. Mutual funds invest in securities after evaluating their creditworthiness as disclosed by the ratings. A depiction of the mutual fund in various investments RATING PROFILE based on their ratings becomes the rating profile of the fund. Typically, this is a feature of debt funds. IDCW Dividend option is renamed as Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal (IDCW) option for all Schemes effective from April 1, 2021 Note: SEBI, vide circular dated June 30, 2009 has abolished entry load and mandated that the upfront commission to distributors will be paid by the investor directly to the distributor, based on his assessment of various factors including the service rendered by the distributor.
